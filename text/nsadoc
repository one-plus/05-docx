How to Mirror the EFFs NSA Document Archive
Unfortunately, the EFF doesn't do a great job of giving us an easy way to archive their entire document store, so I had to hack around a bit to make it work. Here's the steps:

Make a new directory, cd into it: 
mkdir nsadocs ; cd nsadocs
Mirror the site: 
wget -mkxKE -e robots=off https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/nsadocs
Get the PDF links: 
cd www.eff.org/document/ ; cat * | grep -ohe ">https://www.eff.org/files.*<" | sed -e 's/<//' -e 's/>//' > list.txt
Download the whole list: 
wget -i list.txt
Copy out the PDFs and you're golden.
