Installing VMware Tools in Kali Linux Rolling

su root
vmware-installer -u vmware-workstation

apt update && apt -y full-upgrade

# Reboot now in case you have updated to a new kernel. Once rebooted:
apt -y --reinstall install open-vm-tools-desktop fuse
reboot
Adding Support for Shared Folders When Using OVT
Unfortunately, shared folders will not work out of the box. To enable this feature for your current session, you will need to execute the following script after logging in:

cat <<EOF > /usr/local/sbin/mount-shared-folders
#!/bin/bash
vmware-hgfsclient | while read folder; do
  vmwpath="/mnt/hgfs/\${folder}"
  echo "[i] Mounting \${folder}   (\${vmwpath})"
  mkdir -p "\${vmwpath}"
  umount -f "\${vmwpath}" 2>/dev/null
  vmhgfs-fuse -o allow_other -o auto_unmount ".host:/\${folder}" "\${vmwpath}"
done
sleep 2s
EOF
chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/mount-shared-folders
If you wish to make it a little easier, you can add a shortcut to the desktop (and allow the script to be executed upon double clicking if you are you are using GNOME):

ln -sf /usr/local/sbin/mount-shared-folders /root/Desktop/mount-shared-folders
gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences executable-text-activation 'ask'
Restarting OVT
If OVT stops functioning correctly, such as Copy/Paste between host and guest, the following script may help out:

cat <<EOF > /usr/local/sbin/restart-vm-tools
#!/bin/bash
systemctl stop run-vmblock\\\\x2dfuse.mount
killall -q -w vmtoolsd
systemctl start run-vmblock\\\\x2dfuse.mount
systemctl enable run-vmblock\\\\x2dfuse.mount
vmware-user-suid-wrapper vmtoolsd -n vmusr 2>/dev/null
vmtoolsd -b /var/run/vmroot 2>/dev/null
EOF
chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/restart-vm-tools
ln -sf /usr/local/sbin/restart-vm-tools /root/Desktop/restart-vm-tools
gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences executable-text-activation 'ask'
Installing VMware Tools in Older Kali Versions
The latest version of vmware-tools at this date compiles against our kernel, albeit with several warnings. We utilise a set of vmware-tool patches to facilitate the installation.

cd ~/
apt-get install git gcc make linux-headers-$(uname -r)
git clone https://github.com/rasa/vmware-tools-patches.git
cd vmware-tools-patches/
Next, mount the VMware tools ISO by clicking “Install VMware Tools” from the appropriate menu. Once the VMware Tools ISO has been attached to the virtual machine, copy the installer to the downloads directory and then run the installer script :

cd ~/vmware-tools-patches/
cp /media/cdrom/VMwareTools-9.9.0-2304977.tar.gz downloads/
./untar-and-patch-and-compile.sh
