Installing Node.js on Kali Linux
Most of the guides I’ve found on how to do this are fairly involved, requiring you to build from source and install without a .dpkg, which is messy if you ever want to change your installation. Installing Node.js is the same as for Debian:

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
The package build-essential is required for compiling and installing native packages, but it’s already included in Kali’s base image.

What are NodeJs & NPM
NodeJs to put it simply is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side web application.

Npm is the a package manager for javascript using to install and run things Such as Grunt

For more information on NodeJs or NPM follow the links in the more reading section of this post.

How to install using git
I usually find the easiest way to install both NodeJs and NPM on linux systems is straight from git. It provides the latest version and allows for patches to node and npm to be updated using pull requests and more from git, either way that’s out of scope for this tutorial so keeping it simple.

Open up a terminal and type the following

# Make our directory to keep it all in

mkdir  ~/local

# Add the location to our path so that we can call it with bash

echo ‘export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH’ >> ~/.bashrc

Now we can start with downloading and compiling

NodeJs First

git clone git://github.com/nodejs/node.git

cd node

./configure –-prefix=~/local

make install

cd ..

Now NPM (Node Package Manager)

git clone git://github.com/npm/npm.git

cd npm

make install

cd ../

and that’s it we are done . . .

Testing our installation
Open up a command prompt and type

node –version

npm -v

Both should return a version number at the time of writing this I got npm v3.5.4 and NodeJs v6.0.0-pre
